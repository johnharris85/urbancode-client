## Python client for interacting UrbanCode Web APIs

 The primary client provides a Pythonic interface to UrbanCode for simplifying
 setup, administration, and testing of UrbanCode tools. The goal is to provide
 some working examples of API access to various pieces of functionality and I
 will refactor reusable bits as I can to make a more usable "client" for future
 use.

### Setup

These examples are built and tested with Python2 but I have tried not to do any
thing or use any pip modules that will break in Python3. Install the requirements
for these helpers are identified in the requirements.txt file:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
